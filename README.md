# Baby Rudin Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from **Principles of Mathematical Analysis** (commonly known as *Baby Rudin*), authored by Walter Rudin. The goal of this project is to provide clear, well-explained solutions to aid my understanding of real analysis and to contribute to the mathematical community.

## Progress and Updates
I will be updating this repository regularly as I work through the exercises. The solutions will be written with clarity and rigor, aiming for correctness and completeness. If errors are found, I will revise them accordingly.

## Structure
The solutions are organized by chapter as follows:

```
ðŸ“‚ BabyRudin-Solutions/
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Chapter1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution_1.1.pdf
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution_1.2.pdf
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Chapter2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution_2.1.pdf
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution_2.2.pdf
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Each solution is provided in PDF format (and possibly LaTeX source files in the future). Explanations will be as detailed as necessary to ensure clarity.

## Contributions
This repository is mainly for my personal learning, but if you find mistakes or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Collaboration is welcome!

## Disclaimer
These solutions are my own work and may contain errors. They are intended for learning purposes and not as a replacement for working through the problems independently.
